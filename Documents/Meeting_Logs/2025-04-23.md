## Notes

We focused on creating our physical database implementation using PostgreSQL on Supabase. We reviewed the DDL scripts and successfully created all 11 tables with appropriate constraints and relationships. The team implemented trigger functions to enforce business rules such as borrowing limits and item availability tracking. We also began data population to validate our schema design, creating test records for items, clients, borrowing transactions, and other entities.

Several challenges were addressed regarding trigger implementation, particularly for enforcing borrowing rules and maintaining consistent item statuses. The team verified that all constraints and triggers work as expected through test transactions.

## Task Completion Confirmation
