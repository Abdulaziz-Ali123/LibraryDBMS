## Meeting Details

**Date**: April 1 2025

**Time**: 4:00pm to 6:00pm

**Location**: Sphar 2324

**Objective**: Convert the conceptual model (ER diagram) of the Library Database Management System into a logical relational schema that defines tables, attributes, data types, primary/foreign keys, and functional dependencies.

## Team Members Present

- [x] Abdulaziz Ali  
- [x] Zain Ghosheh  
- [x] Mahgoub Husien  
- [x] Abdulahi Mohamed  
- [x] Subat Qutlan

## Notes

We are moving forward with translating our ER diagram into a relational schema. This includes defining relations, specifying primary and foreign keys, listing functional dependencies, and assigning domains to each attribute.

The logical schema will follow classroom algorithms and will serve as the foundation for our implementation. This step ensures data integrity, normalization, and efficient querying.

The system handles three types of library materials: Books, Digital Media, and Magazines. Membership types are Standard, Student, and Senior — each with its own borrowing limits and fee policies. All borrowing, reservation, renewal, and fee-tracking features from the conceptual design will be supported in this schema.

We will also generate a relational schema diagram and a data dictionary to document attribute types and constraints.

## Task Completion Confirmation

- **Entire Team**: Reviewed the conceptual model and ready to begin logical schema mapping ✅
